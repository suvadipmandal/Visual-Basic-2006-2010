I have a built in splash screen, and I set a handler as such:

If Not My.Application.SplashScreen Is Nothing Then

AddHandler My.Application.SplashScreen.Deactivate, AddressOf SplashScreen1_Deactivate

End If

'And here is the sub

Private Sub SplashScreen1_Deactivate(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)

MsgBox(Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.Name)

End Sub

Sub Main()

Dim frmSplash as new splashscreen

dim frmMain as new MainForm

frmsplash.show()

' Do expensive work here

frmSplash.close()

frmMain.show()

End Sub
